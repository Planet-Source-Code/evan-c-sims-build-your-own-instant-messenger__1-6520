### Description

[UPDATED: April 02, 2000] One of the questions I get asked most is "Hey Evan, any idea on how I can make my own ICQ?". I have recently been spending a lot of my time building just such a thing in Visual Basic 6, so I thought I would share the knowledge I have attained. This is, to my knowledge, the first tutorial available on the web for making an instant messenger of this kind in VB6. I am not going to go into great detail on how to use the code here. Instead, go to this tutorial's webpage at http://pfh.uo2station.com/docs/vb6_makeicq.html
